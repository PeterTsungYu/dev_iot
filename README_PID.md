# PID Control Framework
This is a framework extended from the PID module proposed in [jckantor/CBE30338 Chemical Process Control](https://github.com/jckantor/CBE30338.git).
Before using this repository, it is recommended to take a look at [Chapter 4.0 PID Control](https://jckantor.github.io/CBE30338/04.00-PID_Control.html).

This repo allows you to have a PID-based control strategy over your devices.
Besides some basic parameters like Kp, Ki, and kd, other parameters are introduced to have a more comprehensive control strategy.
The main purpose of this project is to reach steady-states of chemical processes.
Hence, the 
In this PID control framework, you could adjust the response time, increment of each step, magnitude of responding kicks, range of
